###
###be careful with margins. set the space between two elements carefully with one specific approach, have your own one. use margin-bottom.
### width  = width+padding+margin, so if you give same width to two divs and diff padding, eventually thay will have different widths.
### good practice to use background-image, background-repeat, background-position-x/y.
###if you put block element inside a div, div will take the whole body width.(parent width)
### if you give body width:100vw, it will have horizontal scroll because 100vw = body+vertical scroll width(4-5px), so you will try to give body the width more than itself.
